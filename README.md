### Purpose of this program 

The program parses the latex citation library files (*.bib) into instances of different classes according to their types, and prints them into a new file with a tidy form. In addition, since it parses the text file into structured data, many operations can be done which would be tedious for human beings. For example, one can check duplications in the citation, which is also included in this program.

### How to use

Just run the file 'bib_reformat.py', only standard packages are used. Change variables 'old_bib_name' and 'new_bib_name' in that file if necessary.
